The  enclosed  allocator  works  with  binutils-2.12,  gcc-3.0.4,  and
glibc-2.2.5 on  x386 Linux.   The project is  a working example  of an
allocator as described in Bjarne  Stroustrup's 3rd Edition of the _The
C++ Programming Language_.  This work  is also part of the J2K library
and is released under a GPL license there.

This allocator  is a shared,  pooled memory allocator.   The resulting
objects  are visible  to all  processes which  attached to  the shared
memory segments.  The allocator allows developers to share the cotents
of their  vectors, maps,  sets, etc amoung  multiple processes  on the
same machine.


This release moves the allocator  away from STLPORT and toward the GNU
C++ compiler and libraries.
